//! Shared fights (docs/coop/SPECS.md S13; docs/coop/PLAN.md M6): the host's game is the
//! authority for actors that are not players.
//!
//! **State.** About 20 times a second the host reads the actors its game runs around its player
//! (`coop_engine::fight::near`) and tracks each placed one in coop-core's actor ledger
//! (`ActorHost`), pinned to the host as its owner, so the ledger's own rules announce it to the
//! guests in that space and relay its states (place, heading, health, life, combat flag, combat
//! target). A guest holds every such actor that is in its own space the way an avatar is held:
//! AI off, moved to the host's place, health set to the host's, killed through the game when the
//! host says it died. An actor the host no longer runs is given back to the guest's game.
//!
//! **Damage.** A guest's weapon hit on a held actor never touches the guest's copy: the hit wrap
//! keeps it, and it goes to the host as coop-core's `ActorMsg::Hit`. The ledger judges it (one
//! per id, a rate limit, the same space, not dead, an essential actor never below 1), and what
//! it accepts the host's game applies through its own damage applier, credited to the guest's
//! avatar; a kill the ledger decides is the game's `Actor::Kill`. The result comes back in the
//! actor's next state, and a death also through the story channel. A hit of the host's actors on
//! a guest's avatar is kept from the avatar and becomes coop-core's `PlayerHurt` through the
//! host's vitals; the guest's game applies it to its own player.
//!
//! **Threat.** Twice a second coop-core's `ThreatDirector` picks, for each of the host's actors
//! that is fighting a player, the player it attends to; when that is another player than the
//! game's own choice the host's game is asked to start that combat (the body of `StartCombat`),
//! against the guest's avatar or the host's player. An actor fighting someone who is not a
//! player is left alone. Avatars stop being ghosts so that they can be fought (on a guest too: its
//! game runs the actors near its player after a hand-off).
//!
//! **Downed and revive.** In a session a player does not die at once: the game's kill of its
//! own player is held, the player is left with 1 health and no controls, and the machine tells
//! the host (`RulesMsg::ReportDown`). coop-core's `Reviver` runs the rest on the host: another
//! player standing next to the downed one (this machine asks for them, there is no key to hold
//! yet) revives them after its hold time at its share of health; nobody coming in its window is
//! a respawn (up again at full health where they lie); everyone down is a wipe, and then every
//! game lets its player die as the game does.
