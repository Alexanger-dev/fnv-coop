//! Where a copy of an actor another game runs is shown (docs/coop/DECISIONS.md D6, stage B): the
//! owner's states, played back a little behind its clock so that the copy moves smoothly along
//! the owner's path instead of jumping to each state as it arrives.
//!
//! The owner sends a state about every 50 ms while the actor changes, with the time on the
//! owner's clock (`ActorState::ms`), and none while it stands still. A [`Track`] keeps the recent
//! states; [`Track::at`] answers the place at `now - DELAY_MS` on the owner's clock, between the
//! two states around that time. The owner's clock is matched to this one by the smallest
//! difference between a state's arrival and its time seen so far (the quickest delivery), which
//! is let rise slowly in case the two clocks drift. Nothing is guessed past the newest state: an
//! actor whose states stop is shown where the last one put it.
//!
//! A gap between two states longer than [`GAP_MS`] means the actor stood still in between (no
//! state is sent while nothing changes): the earlier place is held until one send interval
//! before the later state, and only then does the copy move on. Two states further apart than
//! [`JUMP_DIST`] are a jump of the owner's own (a door, a `MoveTo`): the copy jumps with it rather
//! than sliding across.
