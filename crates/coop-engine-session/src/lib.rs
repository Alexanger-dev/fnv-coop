//! Co-op's session on the translated engine (docs/coop/DECISIONS.md D2; docs/coop/SPECS.md S5).
//!
//! A thin driver over coop-core's sync. The host's game is the story's authority; the guests'
//! games follow it.
//!
//! - [`HostDriver`]: at its start writes every quest's record and script variables; then once per
//!   frame, between the game's frames, drains co-op's change journal, reads again the record
//!   ([`record`]) and variables of every quest that changed and every global whose value changed,
//!   and writes them into coop-core's `HostSync`, which sends joins their snapshot, then deltas,
//!   and hashes.
//! - [`GuestDriver`]: once per frame, takes the host's messages into `GuestSync` and applies what
//!   changed in its replica to the guest's game: quests through `quest::apply`, quest variables and
//!   globals through the game's values, all inside the script gate, so the story's scripts run only
//!   on the host.
//! - [`echo`]: reads the guest's game back and compares it with the replica, so a test (and a
//!   run on a PC) checks the game itself, not only the replica.
//!
//! The transport is coop-core's `Transport`: coop-net's endpoint in the game, the loopback and
//! chaos transports in tests.
