//! A game's copies of actors another game runs show what that game's actor does (docs/coop/
//! DECISIONS.md D6, stage B): they fight whom it fights and attack when it attacks.
//!
//! Each actor is run by one game (its owner: the host's, or the nearest guest's after a
//! hand-off); the other games have a copy of it, with its AI on so that it walks and is animated
//! by its own game. Left to itself, a copy chose its own combat target (often its own game's
//! player) and attacked on its own: in one game the actor faced one player while in the other it
//! shot the other one. Two wraps take that away from the copies, and from nothing else:
//!
//! - its target: a wrap of the combat controller's change of target (`00980830`, the one place
//!   every change goes through) puts the target the owner's actor has, as the session names it
//!   ([`set_copies`]), in place of the copy's own choice, when the copy's combat group knows that
//!   target. [`aim`] turns a copy to it at once; one whose group does not know it yet is started
//!   on a combat with it by the session (`fight::start_combat`).
//! - its attacks: a wrap of `Actor::QueueAttack` (`008935f0`, the combat procedures' only way to
//!   attack) refuses a copy's own attacks; the owner's are replayed on it ([`replay`]). On every
//!   other actor the wrap notes each attack its game queues ([`attack_of`]), for the session to
//!   publish with the actor's state.
//!
//! What a copy's attack does to a player is decided as before (`fight::hit_me`): a replayed
//! attack is still a hit in the copy's game, and the hit wrap keeps it there when the damage is
//! another game's.
//!
//! An actor its own game runs is never touched: the wraps do as the game does for any actor not
//! named a copy, and a copy left to its own AI (one in a conversation or a scene) is not named.
