//! Rewards the shared story gives (docs/coop/SPECS.md S25). The story's scripts run in the host's
//! game only, and there `Player` is the host's player: a `RewardXP` or a `Player.AddItem` (caps are
//! an item) in a quest's stage or in a line's result gives that player alone. The rules give every
//! player the full reward once (`reward: everyone`, every row of the bundled table): the host's
//! game notes each such reward ([`take`]), and each guest's game gives its own player the same
//! ([`give`]).
//!
//! A reward counts as the story's when the script running is a quest's own or has an owner quest
//! (a stage's result, a quest's script), or is a line's result (its line's quest), unless that
//! quest is one each player plays for themself ([`crate::gate::set_own_quests`]): its rewards are
//! that player's. An object script with no quest runs in every game that has the object, so each
//! game gives its own.
//!
//! A guest's game runs the story's lines an NPC says outside its player's conversation (Sunny
//! handing over her rifle at the bottles): their rewards are noted there too, and the host gives
//! its own player and the other guests the same. Its player's own conversation's results are held
//! for the host and run there.
